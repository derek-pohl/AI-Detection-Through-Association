# AI Detection Through Association

Estimate if a piece of text is AI generated by analyzing the ideas inside the text, not the writing style.

## Overview
This tool uses a different approach to AI text detection by comparing the core ideas in a submitted text to those in a freshly generated AI text on the same topic. Instead of focusing on writing style, it measures the overlap of ideas, providing a likelihood that the text was generated by AI. This means that even if a text was passed through a "humanizer" or re-written by a human, it could still flag as AI generated.

## How It Works
1. **User submits text** to the web interface.
2. The app generates a prompt based on the user's text and asks an AI model to produce a new text on the same topic.
3. The app compares the ideas in the user's text and the AI-generated text, identifying shared and unique ideas.
4. Based on the overlap, the app classifies the text as "Possibly AI", "Maybe AI", or "Likely not AI".

## Features
- Focuses on idea similarity, not writing style.
- Uses Google Gemini (Generative AI) API with key rotation for reliability. You can get a free API key at [Google AI Studio](aistudio.google.com).
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- JSON-based result structure for easy integration.
- Deployable on Vercel or locally.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set up your `.env` file with your Google API key(s):
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEYS=your_key1,your_key2,...
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` and use the web interface.

## Deployment
- Supports deployment on Vercel (see `vercel.json`).
- Static assets in `static/`, templates in `templates/`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Flask
